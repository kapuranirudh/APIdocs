                    explanation: "This magnificent spiral galaxy is Messier 64, often\
                      \ called the Black Eye Galaxy or the Sleeping Beauty Galaxy\
                      \ for its dark-lidded appearance in telescopic views. The spiral's\
                      \ central region, about 7,400 light-years across, is pictured\
                      \ in this reprocessed image from the Hubble Space Telescope.\
                      \ M64 lies some 17 million light-years distant in the otherwise\
                      \ well-groomed northern constellation Coma Berenices. The enormous\
                      \ dust clouds partially obscuring M64's central region are laced\
                      \ with young, blue star clusters and the reddish glow of hydrogen\
                      \ associated with star forming regions.  But imposing clouds\
                      \ of dust are not this galaxy's only peculiar feature. Observations\
                      \ show that M64 is actually composed of two concentric, counter-rotating\
                      \ systems. While all the stars in M64 rotate in the same direction\
                      \ as the interstellar gas in the galaxy's central region, gas\
                      \ in the outer regions, extending to about 40,000 light-years,\
                      \ rotates in the opposite direction. The dusty eye and bizarre\
                      \ rotation are likely the result of a billion year old merger\
                      \ of two different galaxies."

                      This faint asymmetric halo CME overlaps with partial halo CME
                      with ID 2023-07-10T04:00:00-CME-001 in the coronagraph imagery.
                      Only one frame of this CME is visible in available STEREO A
                      COR2 imagery due to a data gap from 2023-07-10T04:53Z-07:23Z.
                      This CME is believe to be on the back side as there are no clear
                      candidate eruptions in available EUV imagery along the Sun-Earth
                      line.

                      note: Uncertain analysis since this CME overlaps with the 2023-07-27T21:36Z
                        CME as this previous CME is leaving the coronagraph imagery.
                        What we believe is the front of this CME is somewhat speculative.
                        This analysis is based on the location of the associated flare
                        and eruption.
